# http-proxy ðŸ”€

Is a simple HTTP proxy server written in NodeJS. It can be used to proxy requests to another server, allowing you to 
intercept and modify requests and responses.

This uses the 'http-proxy-middleware' and is designed to be lightweight and easy to use.

## Usage

```docker-compose
services:
  http-proxy:
    image: ghcr.io/jimcronqvist/http-proxy:latest
    container_name: http-proxy
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    environment:
      - UPSTREAM=http://service.svc.cluster.local:3000
```

The handlers can also have their own environment variables, please refer to the specific handler file for more information (e.g. `handlers/log.mjs` has `LOG_REQUEST`, `LOG_RESPONSE`, `LOG_REQUEST_BODY`, `LOG_RESPONSE_BODY`, `LOG_IP`).

## Handlers

You can create custom request handlers to modify requests and responses. 
The default handler is `log.mjs`, which does some basic logging.

You can create your own handler by creating a file in the `handlers` directory and setting the `HANDLER_FILE` 
environment variable to the name of your file.

See for example [log.mjs](./handlers/log.mjs).

A handler file should export one or two functions.
- onRequest(req, res): This function is called when a request is received. You can modify the request here.
- onResponse(req, res): This function is called when a response is received. You can modify the response here.

Example:
```javascript
export function onRequest(req, res) {
    // Modify request here
    console.log(`Request to ${req.url}`);
}

export function onResponse(req, res, payload, proxyRes) {
    // Modify response here
    console.log(`Response from ${req.url}`);
}
```

## OpenTelemetry

If you want to use tracing, you can change the command like this:

```docker-compose
    command: node --import ./tracing.mjs app.mjs
```

or use the `ENABLE_TRACING` environment variable:
```docker-compose
    environment:
      - ENABLE_TRACING=true
```

## Response buffering vs streaming

- **Passthrough (no handler)**: If no `onResponse` is provided, responses are streamed directly to the client. Header `X-Http-Proxy-Mode: passthrough`.

- **With `onResponse`**:
  - The proxy decides to buffer or stream based on content type and size.
  - Buffering is attempted only for these content types: `application/json`, `application/xml`, `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`, `text/html`, `text/plain`, `text/xml`.
  - If the response has a known `content-length` less than or equal to `BUFFER_SIZE_MB` (in bytes), it is buffered; otherwise it streams.
  - If `content-length` is unknown, the proxy will start buffering and will automatically switch to streaming if the in-memory buffer exceeds `BUFFER_SIZE_MB`.
  - When streaming, `onResponse` is not called. When buffering completes, `onResponse(req, res, payload, proxyRes)` receives the buffered text payload.
  - Header `X-Http-Proxy-Mode` is set to `buffer` or `stream` accordingly.

- **Error handling**:
  - While streaming, any pipe errors return `502 Bad Gateway` if the response hasnâ€™t been sent yet.
  - While buffering, errors inside `onResponse` return `500 Internal Server Error`.
  - Proxy transport errors are surfaced as `500 Internal Server Error` with a log entry.

## Cookie rewriting

By default (`STRIP_COOKIE_DOMAIN=true`), the proxy removes the `Domain` attribute from `Set-Cookie` headers in upstream responses. This causes the browser to scope cookies to the proxyâ€™s host, which avoids cross-domain cookie issues when proxying.

- Set `STRIP_COOKIE_DOMAIN=false` to preserve the upstream `Domain` exactly as sent (useful when you intentionally need cross-domain/subdomain scoping).
